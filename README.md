# 11ty-boilerplate

My own little 11ty starter project. Originally based off https://css-tricks.com/eleventy-starter-with-tailwind-css-alpine-js/

To run local dev server, run `ntl dev`

Includes:

-   Tailwind CSS
-   AlpineJS
-   Uses Nunjucks for layouts and partials, HTML for pages
-   Netlify-ready
-   HTML and CSS is minified on build, and \_site is deleted
